# Olukelo Gimbal Files

These files are taken from a fork of the [Olukelu Gimbal](https://github.com/o-devices/o-joystick-hdk) by [Scrath1](https://github.com/Scrath1/o-joystick-hdk)
which has the benefit of including re-exported STEP files.

These files are necessary to print for the entire gimbal base to attach the joystick too. There will be a BOM section that specifies all of the correct
bolt heads and sizings as well as recommended springs to use on the gimbal.

### Instructions
All files are in their correct orientation by default (when tested with Prusa Slicer 2.5). There is an alternate housing that will be added later that
integrates the microcontroller board and some useful buttons and switches for people that don't have a separate button box (or do, but want more buttons).

The gimbal_cam.stl (4 pieces) should be printed out of PLA for low deformation. The gimbal itself can be printed of PET, PETG, ABS, or possibly nylon. I have tested it with
FormFutura recycled PET and it has good flexibility and enough rigidity. I will perhaps do some later testing on how to PLA holds up for the cams. 


### License Considerations
I did not create, modify, or remix these files, they are only being distributed in order to have a repository of a full, working set of 3D files in case the
Olukelu files get lost somehow. These files fall under the [CC BY-NC-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/) license according to the original
